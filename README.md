# Neo4j Query Verifier

## Intent

This project is designed to help validate queries from a `query.log` file against a specific Neo4j version.

If you need to upgrade from version X to version Y and want to ensure all your queries remain valid, you can generate a query log in version X and then run this script against version Y, using the query log from the previous version as input.

## Usage

### Driver

Ensure you use the driver version that corresponds to the Neo4j version you're testing against. Set it in the `requirements.txt` file.

First, install the requirements by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Local Neo4j Instance

If you have a running Neo4j instance you want to test against, use the following command:

```bash
python3 query-verifier.py --input-path=$QUERY_LOGS_PATH --output-path=$RESULT_OUTPUT_PATH --uri=$NEO4J_URI --username=$NEO4J_USERNAME --password=$NEO4J_PASSWORD --query-log-bolt-port=7687
```

## Docker Neo4j Instance

You can validate against any Neo4j version by choosing the version to run as a Docker container:

```bash
python3 query-verifier.py --input-path=$QUERY_LOGS_PATH --output-path=$RESULT_OUTPUT_PATH --neo4j-target-version=5.19.0-enterprise --query-log-bolt-port=7687
```

### Important:

Ensure the `BOLT` port in your query log file corresponds to the one passed to the `--query-log-bolt-port` parameter.

## Execution Results

Imagine your query log contains the following query, which is deprecated in version 5.19:

```plaintext
2024-05-17 08:54:50.493+0000 INFO  0 ms: (planning: 0, waiting: 0) - 7818 page hits, 0 page faults - bolt-session bolt neo4j-java/4.4.11-7d3fdc18543dae49c0c337b2885771b4f38a288d client/172.18.0.6:58674 server/172.18.0.4:7687> - RETURN 1 as my\u0085identifier - {currentId: '4b640479-63be-4e94-9b9b-53f23e9fb53a'} - {}
2024-05-17 08:54:50.493+0000 INFO  0 ms: (planning: 0, waiting: 0) - 7818 page hits, 0 page faults - bolt-session bolt neo4j-java/4.4.11-7d3fdc18543dae49c0c337b2885771b4f38a288d client/172.18.0.6:58674 server/172.18.0.4:7687> - SHOW EXISTS CONSTRAINTS - {currentId: '4b640479-63be-4e94-9b9b-53f23e9fb53a'} - {}
```

If you run it against a version earlier than 5.19, the output should be an empty file with only one header:

```plaintext
query,category,message
```

Otherwise, if you run it against version 5.19 or later, you might see something like this:

```plaintext
query,category,message
RETURN 1 as my\u0085identifier,DEPRECATION,"The Unicode character `\u0085` is deprecated for unescaped identifiers and will be considered as a whitespace character in the future. To continue using it, escape the identifier by adding backticks around the identifier `myÂ…identifier`."
SHOW EXISTS CONSTRAINTS,Statement,"`SHOW CONSTRAINTS` no longer allows the `EXISTS` keyword, please use `EXIST` or `PROPERTY EXISTENCE` instead. (line 1, column 9 (offset: 8))
""EXPLAIN SHOW EXISTS CONSTRAINTS""
```
