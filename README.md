# Neo4j Query Verifier

## Intent

This project is designed to help validate cypher queries against a specific Neo4j version.

If you need to upgrade from version X to version Y and want to ensure all your queries remain valid, you can collect query logs from version X and then run this script to validate them before the upgrade.
You can test directly against version Y, or against the latest version X. Depending on the target version, deprecated queries will either fail or raise deprecation notifications, both of which will be logged in the output of
this script.

By default the script will start a neo4j version Y container and send it each distinct query it found in the inputs.

## Setup

First, install the requirements by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Driver

Ensure you use the driver version that corresponds to the Neo4j version you're testing against. Set it in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

```bash
python3 query-verifier.py --input-path=$INPUT_PATH --output-path=$RESULT_OUTPUT_PATH --neo4j-target-version 4.4.39-enterprise
```

### Options

- `--input-path <path>` : path to either 
  - a Neo4j query.log file (either in standard or json format), 
  - a directory containing query.log files, or 
  - a single-column CSV file containing a list of cypher queries (for example `all_queries.csv` exported by the healthcheck). cf. `example/all_queries.csv`.
  
  Note that the reliability of the parsing of raw query logs is not guaranteed. It is therefore recommended to use the CSV option.
- `--output-path <path>` : directory where the results are written to. Two files will be generated :
  - `deprecated_queries.csv` : list of queries with deprecation warnings
  - `failed_queries.csv` : list of queries that outright failed
- `--neo4j-target-version <image-tag>` : docker image tag of the neo4j version to test against (as in: `neo4j:<image-tag>`).
  - Defaults to `5-enterprise`. 
  - Refer to https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j for the list of available images.
- Optional `--query-log-bolt-port <port>` : BOLT port of the server that executed the queries.
  - Defaults to 7687. 
  - if standard format query.log(s) are specified as input, make sure the port is correct, as the parsing relies on it (note : that option is not used for CSV or JSON query.log inputs).



As an alternative to using `--neo4j-target-version`, you can provide connection details to an already running Neo4j instance to test against :
- `--uri <uri>` : neo4j URI (ex: neo4j://host:7687).
- `--username <name>` : username of the user used to cnnect to that existing neo4j server
- `--password <pwd>` : password of that user


### Local Neo4j Instance

If you have a running Neo4j instance you want to test against, use the following command:

```bash
python3 query-verifier.py --input-path=some/path//logs --output-path=/path/to/output --uri=neo4j://localhost:7687 --username=neo4j --password=mypassword
```

### Docker Neo4j Instance

You can validate against any Neo4j version by choosing the version to run as a Docker container:

```bash
python3 query-verifier.py --input-path=example/all_queries.csv --output-path=./output --neo4j-target-version=5.19.0-enterprise
```

### Execution Results

Imagine your query log contains the following query, which is deprecated in version 5.19:

```plaintext
2024-05-17 08:54:50.493+0000 INFO  0 ms: (planning: 0, waiting: 0) - 7818 page hits, 0 page faults - bolt-session bolt neo4j-java/4.4.11-7d3fdc18543dae49c0c337b2885771b4f38a288d client/172.18.0.6:58674 server/172.18.0.4:7687> - RETURN 1 as my\u0085identifier - {currentId: '4b640479-63be-4e94-9b9b-53f23e9fb53a'} - {}
2024-05-17 08:54:50.493+0000 INFO  0 ms: (planning: 0, waiting: 0) - 7818 page hits, 0 page faults - bolt-session bolt neo4j-java/4.4.11-7d3fdc18543dae49c0c337b2885771b4f38a288d client/172.18.0.6:58674 server/172.18.0.4:7687> - SHOW EXISTS CONSTRAINTS - {currentId: '4b640479-63be-4e94-9b9b-53f23e9fb53a'} - {}
```

If you run it against a version earlier than 5.19, the output should be an empty file with only one header:

```plaintext
query,category,message
```

Otherwise, if you run it against version 5.19 or later, you might see something like this:

```plaintext
query,category,message
RETURN 1 as my\u0085identifier,DEPRECATION,"The Unicode character `\u0085` is deprecated for unescaped identifiers and will be considered as a whitespace character in the future. To continue using it, escape the identifier by adding backticks around the identifier `myÂ…identifier`."
SHOW EXISTS CONSTRAINTS,Statement,"`SHOW CONSTRAINTS` no longer allows the `EXISTS` keyword, please use `EXIST` or `PROPERTY EXISTENCE` instead. (line 1, column 9 (offset: 8))
""EXPLAIN SHOW EXISTS CONSTRAINTS""
```

## Limitations

Certain cases are not dealt with :

- queries with obfuscated literals (****) may fail to parse
- queries calling procedures or functions from custom plugins (or plugins that are not present on the test server) will fail to execute with a ProcedureNotFound error.
